# Slava
Made by Gabriel Hrastovic. Some code from online resources was used. This is my first canvas project.

Must install webpack for this code to run

 This project took me roughly 70 hours to complete, some notable features are:

-An interactive canvas, with sprites generated from an object constructor, via requestAnimationFrame and delta timestamps for consistency between different computers

-Mobile responsiveness

-Local storage for high scores

-Clean & modulated JavaScript code for easy access to individual components - unlike my Adventure Game project which was really difficult to work on as the single JS file became 1000+ lines of unreadable code





Some issues are:

-Lag spikes, especially with the splatter effect enabled

-Using window to define variables - I did it that way so they can be globally accessed by the seperate JS files but it may be a part of the lag issues


Splatter effect is mutated from this [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/)
