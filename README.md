# Slava

Made by Gabriel Hrastovic. Some code from online resources was used for the sprite and deltatime logic. This is my first canvas project.

You can view the site live on : https://gabrielcro23.github.io/Slava/

This project took me roughly 70 hours:

-An interactive canvas, with sprites generated from an object constructor, via requestAnimationFrame and delta timestamps for consistency between different computers

-Mobile responsiveness

-Local storage for high scores

**Some issues are:**

-Using window to define variables

-The code isn't actually that clean

-On mobile, not sure why but the splatter effect makes only one "bubble" instead of multiple.

-The sprites are much faster on faster computers

Splatter effect is mutated from this [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/)
