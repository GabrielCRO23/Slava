# Slava
Made by Gabriel Hrastovic. Some code from online teaching resources was used. This is my first canvas project.

Must install webpack for this code to run

 This project took me roughly 70 hours of work to complete, **some notable features are:**

-An interactive canvas, with sprites generated from an object constructor, via requestAnimationFrame and delta timestamps for consistency between different computers

-Mobile responsiveness

-Local storage for high scores

-Clean & modulated JavaScript code for easy access to individual components - unlike my Adventure Game project which was really difficult to work on as the single JS file became 1000+ lines of unreadable code





**Some issues are:**

-Using window to define variables - I did it that way so they can be globally accessed by the seperate JS files

-The code isn't actually that clean

-On mobile, not sure why but the splatter effect makes only one "bubble" instead of multiple.

-The sprites are much faster on faster computers


Splatter effect is mutated from this [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/)

_______________________

The game was called "Slava" & sprites are called "orcs" because the original project was supposed to be a Ukraine-inspired game, but it was a little bit too violent to put on a resume - so the bloodsplatter effect and sprites selected were made to be cartoony.
